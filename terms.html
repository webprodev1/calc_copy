The use of our website, products and services is conditional on you being at least 18 years old, and having the ability and capacity to enter into a legally binding contract. By using our website, products and services, you represent that you accept and agree to our Terms and Conditions, outlined below. If you have any questions, please contact us.</p>

<h3>1. Registration Agreement</h3>

<p>Please be aware that you are entering into an agreement that is legally binding and enforceable. These Registration Terms and Conditions (this &quot;Registration Agreement&quot;), the Website Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, and the Cookies Policy posted on our website (collectively the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;) sets out the terms by which V&amp;S Brothers (&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot; or &quot;V&amp;S Brothers&quot;) offers you access to and use of our websites, applications, tools, and services (collectively &quot;Services&quot;). The Website Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, and all Rules &amp; Policies posted on our website are expressly incorporated into this Agreement.</p>

<p>Please be advised that this Agreement defines your legal rights and contains provisions that govern how claims that you and V&amp;S Brothers may have against each other will be resolved (see Section 8 (Dispute Resolution)). It is in your best interest that you read this entire Agreement carefully before accepting it. If you object to anything in this Agreement, or otherwise do not understand or agree to be bound by this Agreement, do not use our Services. If you use our Services in any way, this will signify that you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Please print a copy of this Agreement for your records. We recommend that you retain a copy for future reference.</p>

<p>Please note, we may change this Agreement at any time. We will promptly provide you with notice of such changes as soon as reasonably possible after they are made, but it is your responsibility to review any changes to this Agreement. If you object to any of the changes made to this Agreement, or otherwise do not understand any of the changes made to this Agreement, please cease the use of our Services. Feel free to contact us to discuss any questions you might have regarding any of the changes so that you can continue to use our Services. The continued use of our Services following notice of any change to this Agreement will imply that you agree to be bound by this Agreement in its revised form.</p>

<p>By using our Website, products, and Services, you authorize us to have access to all funds available in your V&amp;S Brothers account to pay a deposit on vehicles ordered by you, make payments for purchased vehicles, US/Canada and international shipping, and/or any other Services provided by us or our affiliates under this Agreement.</p>

<p>V&amp;S Brothers has priced its Services based on your acceptance of the disclaimers, waivers, and allocation of risks as assigned, as provided in this Agreement. You understand and agree that all disclaimers, waivers, and allocation of risks provided herein are essential to the business between you and us, and that without such, V&amp;S Brothers is unable to provide the Services.</p>

<h3>2. Who we are</h3>

<p>V&amp;S Brothers is a registered used car dealer and freight forwarding company. We use a business-to-business model and specialize in the export of vehicles (as used herein, a &quot;vehicle&quot; means any item available for purchase using V&amp;S Brothers&#39;s Services, including cars, trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, boats, jet skis, industrial equipment, trailers, RVs, and other similar vehicles) from the US. We will do the work for you to get the final approval for your cargo to be shipped from the US / Canada. We will prepare and submit all the required export forms. All you have to supply is the commercial invoices and sign the export instructions.</p>

<p>To buy and ship vehicles from the US through our company, you must become a registered user of V&amp;S Brothers.</p>

<p>We provide access to the largest online auto auction inventory in North America, such as ADESA Inc. (&ldquo;Adesa&rdquo;), IAA Inc. (&ldquo;IAA&rdquo;), Copart Inc. (&quot;Copart&quot;) and Manheim Auctions Inc. (&quot;Manheim&rdquo;), which will herein be collectively referred to as &ldquo;Auctions&rdquo; or &ldquo;Auto Auctions&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We assist with the purchase and/or shipping from American and Canadian dealerships, auto salvage yards and private sellers, which will herein be collectively referred to as &ldquo;Seller&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we or one of our affiliated entities will facilitate your purchase of new, used and salvage vehicles that you identify and select as being of interest. A minimum deposit in your V&amp;S Brothers account is required before you will be allowed to bid on and purchase any vehicle (see Deposit Rules &amp; Policies). The minimum deposit is $400. A deposit of 10% of your maximum bid on a vehicle is required. For example, if you plan to place a maximum bid of $10,000, you must make a deposit of $1000 to your account.</p>

<p>You agree to pay us a fee for all Services that we provide to you by the nominated due date. The specific amount of the fee and the way in which the fee is collected is set forth in our Rules &amp; Policies. You must cooperate with us and our affiliated entities, including responding to our calls and emails, and providing information and documents that may be required to process your purchase, the transfer, and or the registration of any vehicle purchased and/or shipped and/or exported using our Services.</p>

<p>We are a registered member of all major US Auto Auctions but are not owned, controlled, endorsed nor recommended by them.</p>

<p>By registering with V&amp;S Brothers and using the V&amp;S Brothers&rsquo;s Services, you acknowledge and understand that you are registering with and purchasing vehicles from V&amp;S Brothers (or its affiliated entities) and not registering with or purchasing vehicles from US Auto Auctions. You understand and agree that V&amp;S Brothers reserves the right to assign some or all of our rights under this Agreement to any of our affiliated entities, and that any purchase made using our Services may be made via one of our affiliated entities. You explicitly consent to such an assignment.</p>

<p>While we may provide information and other guidance as part of our Services, such information and guidance is for informational purposes only and you should decide whether or not to follow it. By using our Services, you understand and agree that (a) we do not own, control, employ, recommend, or endorse any of the independent third-party sellers who own the vehicles available for purchase using our Services; (b) we do not own or possess the vehicles available for purchase using our Services (unless we are listed as the seller or the vehicles are listed on our website); (c) we do not research, verify, confirm, guarantee, or warrant the accuracy or completeness of any Vehicle Information (as defined in Section 6.2 (Vehicle Information Disclaimer)) for any vehicle available for purchase using our Services; and (d) we do not make any representations, warranties, or guarantees of any kind regarding the quality or condition of the vehicles available for purchase using our Services.</p>

<p>e) We are not a car-hauler company but, as a part of Services, we will organize the transport of your vehicles within the US and Canada by outsourcing to car-hauler companies, brokers, and independent contractors. f) We are not an ocean shipping agency and don&rsquo;t own vessels. We will outsource the international transport to ocean carriers who will ship vehicles and cargo from the US to the port selected by you (final destination). Use of our cargo tracking page to see the last reported location is for informational purposes only. You will need the container number or vehicle identification number (VIN) to track your vehicle. We are not responsible for any errors or the accuracy of the tracking.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for any kind of warranty for any vehicle you purchase using our Services (see Section 6 (Disclaimers)).</p>

<p>Purchasing a used or salvage vehicle from an online auto auction marketplace presents many risks. You are solely responsible to obtain sufficient information on a vehicle prior to placing any bid.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for any delays in shipping or release of your vehicles or cargo from any facilities (Auto Auction, Customs, transit warehouses and parking lots), neither in the US/Canada, in transit, nor overseas. Purchased vehicles must be removed from the auction facility promptly. After 5 days of not receiving payments, an auction storage charge of $20/day may be imposed.For vehicles at our exit port locations, we offer 20 days FREE storage from the day the vehicle was delivered to our lot/warehouse. After 20 days, a storage fee of $10/day applies. These fees are non-negotiable and are applied regardless of what caused the shipping delay, whether that be bad weather or a delay with your next vehicle delivery or an ocean line strike.</p>

<h3>3. Your Use of the V&amp;S Brothers Website</h3>

<p>We strive to have the V&amp;S Brothers platform available to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but because of how the internet works, occasionally you may not be able to access the V&amp;S Brothers website, and this might happen for any reason, at any time, with or without notice, or at our absolute discretion. V&amp;S Brothers will not be liable to you for any loss (either data or monetary) you suffer as a result of these things.</p>

<p>As a registered user, you may also have access to products and services provided by a third party (live chat, cargo tracking etc). You have no obligation to use any third party service. However, if you choose to do so, you will then be using the relevant product and/or service from the supplier and not from us. As such, the purchase and use of these products and services will require adhering to the terms and conditions set by the third party. You should read and make sure that you agree to the applicable terms and conditions before purchasing and using any third party product and service.</p>

<h3>4. Rules &amp; Policies</h3>

<p>You understand and agree that only business entities can register as V&amp;S Brothers users. Only auto industry related businesses (such as car dealers, body shops, auto repair services, etc) are allowed to register to purchase and ship vehicles with us.</p>

<p>The minimum number of vehicles to be purchased or shipped using our Services is 10/month.</p>

<p>If you buy less than 10 cars per month, you are required to pay a surcharge of $200/vehicle below the pre-requisite number of vehicles to be purchased per month.</p>

<p>V&amp;S Brothers reserve the right to waive the surcharge at their discretion but this can only be done no more than 3 times per year, where the year commences on the date of your account registration.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to register to still be bound by these Terms when making a single order purchase and/or delivery of heavy equipment.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to register to use our Services to ship international cargo. Please note, we don&rsquo;t provide shipping quotes for international cargo less than 1 m&sup3; or 50 kg.</p>

<h3>5. Your Account</h3>

<p>In order to access certain features of our website and use our Services, you must register to create an account (&quot;User Account&quot;) and accept this Agreement.</p>

<p>As a registered user of the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and to restrict access to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur through your account, which includes taking reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of your username and password. You agree to promptly notify us when you become aware of any unauthorized use of your username, password or other account information, or of any other breach of security involving your account on any portion of the Site.</p>

<p>Each organization may only possess one User&rsquo;s Account . We verify every user of our Services, therefore Users Accounts are not transferable.</p>

<p>V&amp;S Brothers reserves the right, without notice and with its sole discretion, to refuse or restrict access or service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby agree to indemnify V&amp;S Brothers and its affiliates, sublicensees, users, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, and any person claiming by or through any of them, and their respective successors, heirs, and assigns against any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from, or related to any claim brought by a third-party related to your account with us and or to any transaction(s) with you, including, but not limited to, the items listed in Section 7.2 (Liability to, and General Release of, V&amp;S Brothers) (collectively &quot;Third-Party Claim&quot;). Your indemnification obligations shall be subject to the following limitations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(1) Notice. If V&amp;S Brothers seeks indemnification for a Third-Party Claim, we shall give you written notice promptly after we become aware of the facts giving rise to such a claim for indemnification (an &ldquo;Indemnified Claim&rdquo;), and in any event within 90 days, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of the Indemnified Claim and stating the amount of the damages (or if not known, a good faith estimate for the amount of the damages).</li>
	<li>(2) Control. In the event of receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim, you shall have the right to control and defend such a Third-Party Claim, provided such control and defense fully protects the interests of V&amp;S Brothers, in V&amp;S Brothers&rsquo;s sole subject determination. Should you decline to control and defend the Third-Party Claim or should V&amp;S Brothers determine that your control and defense does not fully protect the interest of V&amp;S Brothers, we shall have the right, at any time, to control and defend the Third- Party Claim in such manner as we may deem appropriate. The controlling party shall select counsel, contractors, experts, and consultants of recognized standing and competence reasonably acceptable to the other party, shall take reasonable steps necessary in the investigation, defense or settlement thereof, and shall diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. All parties shall cooperate fully with the party conducting the defense of any Third-Party Claim.</li>

The party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claims subject to the following provisions. If you are controlling the litigation, you may not enter into a settlement or consent to an entry of judgment with respect to any Third-Party Claim without V&amp;S Brothers&rsquo;s express written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If we are controlling the litigation, we may not enter into a settlement or consent to an entry of judgment with respect to any Third-Party Claim without your express written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It shall not be considered unreasonable for V&amp;S Brothers to withhold consent if you have not reimbursed V&amp;S Brothers for their Losses or made arrangements to do so in a manner that is acceptable to V&amp;S Brothers. It shall not be unreasonable for V&amp;S Brothers to withhold consent if the proposed settlement or entry of judgment could negatively impact on V&amp;S Brothers&rsquo;s professional reputation. Regardless of who assumes control and defense of the global Third-Party Claim, V&amp;S Brothers reserves the right to directly settle or otherwise resolve any claim against V&amp;S Brothers.</p>

<h3>12. Third Party Providers of Functionality on the Sites; Access via Mobile Devices</h3>

<p>V&amp;S Brothers may have functionality on a Site that is provided, in whole or in part, by a third party service provider. You can usually identify such third party functionality by the use of a trademark not owned by V&amp;S Brothers on or near the functionality. For such third party functionality, you will need to review the terms of use and privacy policy for that third party, which, in some cases, may require you to visit that party&rsquo;s website and locate their terms of use and privacy policy. Your review should include determining whether such terms and policy are acceptable to you. If they are not, do not use the associated functionality on our Sites. V&amp;S Brothers does not control these third-party services and content.</p>

<p>If you access a Site using an Apple iOS, Android, or Microsoft Windows-powered device, you agree that your access to the Site using these devices shall also be subject to the usage terms set forth in the applicable third-party beneficiary&rsquo;s terms of service, which we encourage you to review. These third parties, while not a direct party in this Agreement, are a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and take the position to enforce any violation by you of this Agreement.</p>
